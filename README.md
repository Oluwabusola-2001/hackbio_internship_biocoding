**Coding for Life Scientists: Python**


In this file, you will find different repositories on the different tasks I worked on during the HACKBIO 2025 Internship(Coding for Bio)

**STAGE 0**
**Coding Syntax, Data types and Data Structures.**

Task Summary:

* Form a team of at least five people with different preferred programming languages.
* Use either R or Python (not both) to store and organize team details in a chosen data structure.
* Display the structured information using a final print statement without using functions, loops, or conditionals.


**STAGE 1**
**Functions Galore**

Task Summary:

* Write a function to translate a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.
* Create a function that simulates logistic population growth, with randomized lag and exponential phases.
* Generate a dataframe containing 100 different growth curves using the logistic growth function.
* Write a function to determine the time required to reach 80% of the carrying capacity.
* Implement a function to compute the Hamming distance between a Slack username and a Twitter/X handle (with padding if needed).


**STAGE 2**
**Microbiology**

Task Summary:

* Open and study the dataset given in a new tab.
* Plot OD600 vs Time growth curves for each strain, overlaying knock-out (-) and knock-in (+) strains.
* Use the previously created function in stage 1 to determine the time to reach carrying capacity for each strain.
* Create a scatter plot comparing the time to reach carrying capacity for knock-out and knock-in strains.
* Generate a box plot to visualize the distribution of carrying capacity times for knock-out and knock-in strains.
* Conduct a statistical analysis to determine if there's a significant difference between the two groups.
* Include comments in the code explaining observations from the analysis.
  

**STAGE 3**
**Age prediction in Humans**

Task Summary:

* Explore the dataset containing 1000 CpG sites for predicting the age of 108 individuals.
* Use a regression model to predict patient age based on CpG site data.
* Perform feature selection to reduce the number of features to 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10.
* Analyze how Mean Squared Error (MSE) changes as the number of features decreases.
* Generate a plot of the number of features against the corresponding MSE values.
