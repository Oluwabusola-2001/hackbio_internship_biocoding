**TASK** 

The task was to evaluate my undertanding on functions in Python. The instructions were to:

1. Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2. Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase [See population curve here] . Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
3. Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves
4. Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
5. Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.

**SOLUTION** 

**Function_1:** I created a dictionary (codon_table) that maps out the dna sequence to the corresponding amino acids. 
                I then defined a function that translates a dna sequence into a protein sequence.

**Function_2:** I defined a logistic_growth function that simulates the population growth curve. 
                I added two extra parameters (lag_phase and exp_phase) to introduce randomness in the lag and exponential phases. The function calculates population size over time based on the logistic growth model.

**Function 3:** I used a loop to create 100 different growth curves with varying parameters for growth rate, initial population, lag phase, and exponential phase. 
                I stored the results in a dictionary and converted it to a dataframe-like structure.

**Function 4:** I defined a function for time_to_80_percent_K that iterates through the population data and identifies the time point when the population reaches 80% of the carrying capacity.

**Function 5:** I defined a hamming_distance function that compares two strings(USERNAME). If the strings are of different lengths, I padded the shorter string with spaces to ensure accurate comparison.

**OUTPUT** 
Function 2 ouput should look like this C:/Users/Administrator/Hackbio_internship_oluwabusola/untitled3.py --wdir
