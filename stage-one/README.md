**TASK** 

The task was to evaluate my undertanding on functions in Python. The instructions were to:

1. Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2. Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase [See population curve here] . Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
3. Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves
4. Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
5. Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.

**SOLUTION** 

The details of each team member are stored in a nested dictionary named team_cysteine_members. Unique keys (team_member1, team_member2, team_member2 and team_member4) are assigned to each team member to easily access their details. A final print statement was used to print team_cysteine_members.


**OUTPUT** 


The ouput should look like this Hackbio_internship_oluwabusola/untitled9.py --wdir {'team_member1': {'name': 'Oluwabusola Asenuga', 'slack_username': 'Oluwabusola', 'email': 'asenugaoluwabusola@gmail.com', 'hobbies': 'watching vlogs, reading novels, dressing up', 'country': 'nigeria', 'discipline': 'zoology', 'preferred_language': 'python'}, 'team_member2': {'name': 'Kaosara Olabode', 'slack_username': 'TheResearchNerd', 'email': 'olabodeomowunmi5@gmail.com', 'hobbies': 'research, travelling, fashion', 'country': 'nigeria', 'discipline': 'natural product chemistry', 'preferred_language': 'R'}, 'team_member3': {'name': 'Himabindu Kumdam', 'slack_username': 'Himabindu', 'email': 'khbiitm@gmail.com', 'hobbies': 'music', 'country': 'india', 'discipline': 'biotechnology', 'preferred_language': 'R'}, 'team_member4': {'name': 'Aisha Mehmood', 'slack_username': 'Aisha', 'email': 'aishamehmood23@gmail.com', 'hobbies': 'reading, shopping', 'country': 'pakistan', 'discipline': 'biotechnology', 'preferred_language': 'R'}}
